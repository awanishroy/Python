    Q. What is a Comment in Python?  
    A comment is a line of code that is ignored by the Python interpreter.  
    It is used to add explanations, improve code readability, or temporarily disable code execution.

    Q. Types of Comments in Python  

    1. Single-Line Comment  
       - Begins with the `#` symbol.
       - Used for short explanations or disabling a single line of code.

       Example:
       # This is a single-line comment
       print("Hello, World!")  # This prints a message

    2. Multi-Line Comment (Using Triple Quotes)  
       - Uses triple singl or triple double quotes.
       - Often used for documentation or disabling multiple lines.

       Example:
       '''
        This is a multi-line comment.
        It spans multiple lines.
       '''
       print("Python comments example")

        Q. Why Use Comments?  
        - Explain complex logic  
        - Improve code readability  
        - Help in debugging  
        - Provide documentation for functions/classes  

        Q. Can Comments Affect Code Execution?  
        - No, comments are ignored by Python and do not affect program execution.  
        - However, excessive comments can make code harder to read.  

        Q. Best Practices for Writing Comments  
        - Keep comments concise and meaningful.  
        - Use single-line comments for brief notes.  
        - Use multi-line comments for detailed explanations.  
        - Update comments when modifying code.  
        - Avoid redundant comments (e.g., `# Increment x by 1` when writing `x += 1`).
